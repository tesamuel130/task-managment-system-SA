# Task Management System Development Tasks

## 1. Planning & Setup
1. Initialize a monorepo using Nx or Turborepo for managing microservices and frontend.
2. Set up a NestJS project for User, Task, Notification Services, and API Gateway.
3. Configure PostgreSQL or MongoDB for persistent storage.
4. Set up Redis for caching and pub/sub.
5. Install and configure Kafka for event-driven communication.
6. Create Dockerfiles for each service and the frontend.
7. Set up a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube or Kind.
8. Configure NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
9. Create a `.env.example` file for environment variables.
10. Initialize a GitHub repository with a basic `README.md` and setup instructions.

## 2. Core Features
1. **User Service**:
   - Implement user registration, login, and profile management with JWT authentication.
   - Cache user sessions in Redis.
2. **Task Service**:
   - Build CRUD operations for tasks (create, read, update, delete).
   - Store tasks in PostgreSQL/MongoDB and cache metadata in Redis.
   - Publish task events (e.g., task created, updated) to Kafka.
3. **Notification Service**:
   - Implement real-time notifications using Redis Pub/Sub or WebSockets.
   - Consume task events from Kafka to trigger notifications.
4. **API Gateway**:
   - Set up a GraphQL server with NestJS for unified API access.
   - Implement queries, mutations, and subscriptions for tasks and users.
5. **Frontend**:
   - Build a React/Next.js app with Apollo Client for GraphQL integration.
   - Create pages for login, task creation, and task listing.
   - Implement real-time task updates using GraphQL subscriptions.
6. **Service Communication**:
   - Implement a TCP server in the Notification Service using Node.js `net` module.
   - Configure Task Service as a TCP client to send task updates to Notification Service.

## 3. State & Queries
1. Use TypeORM or Mongoose for database interactions in NestJS services.
2. Implement Redis caching for user sessions and task metadata.
3. Set up Kafka topics for task events (e.g., `task.created`, `task.updated`).
4. Use Apollo Client in the frontend for GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

## 4. CI/CD & Deployment
1. Create a GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing, building, and pushing Docker images.
2. Set up Kubernetes manifests for deployments, services, and NGINX ingress.
3. Deploy the application locally using Minikube or to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS EKS, GKE).
4. Configure NGINX for load balancing and routing to the API Gateway.

## Notes for Implementation
1. Complete and test each task before moving to the next.
2. Create a separate Git branch for each feature or service.
3. Write unit and integration tests using Jest for each service.
4. Document APIs using GraphQL schema and comments in code.
5. Maintain consistent error handling across services (e.g., use NestJS exception filters).
6. Follow TypeScript best practices and enforce strict typing.
7. Ensure Docker images are optimized for size and performance.
8. Test Kubernetes deployments locally before cloud deployment.
9. Use environment variables for sensitive configurations (e.g., database URLs, Kafka brokers).
